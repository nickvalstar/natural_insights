Natural Insights is a shiny application (an app) i have written that helps with keeping track of your monthly cycle and may assist in using the calendar method for birth control.

I have made the code available, feel free to take a look.
The app is not usable at this point for I've hidden the info needed for connecting to the underlying mysql database.

ToDo:
-Create some dummy data and host it online, so that people can see how it looks/works.
-Make it publicly available for use with some kind of login.
